## Quicc Note

A simple note-taking and drawing app that shares your content with your local network. Functionality is intentionally kept simple. 

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm i 
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
